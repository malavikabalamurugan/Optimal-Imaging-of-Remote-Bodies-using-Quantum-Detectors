This is an executable paper in the form of a python notebook based on the paper: 

L. A. Howard, G. G. Gillett, M. E. Pearce, R. A. Abrahao, T. J. Weinhold, P. Kok, and A. G. White, Optimal imaging of remote bodies using quantum detectors, Phys.Rev. Lett. 123, 143604 (2019). 
We performed some simulations of classical imaging and compared it to the image following a quantum framework of simulations as decribed in the paper. This project was undertaken by undergraduate sophomore students at the Physics Department of IIT Bombay, under the supervision of Prof. Anshuman Kumar.
